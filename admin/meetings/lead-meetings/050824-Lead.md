# 05-01-24 Lead Meeting with Dev

## Notes
- Dev really likes our features
- Dev is worried about Postgres because he said the professor doesn't like us making it complicated
  - wants us to use local data storage first
- what's professor's take on APIs?
  - professor is fine with API
  - professor doesn't want us to make tools from scratch
  - if we feel like we can do a better job using google calendar API, go for it
  - don't use random APIs for the sake of it
  - try to keep fancy features at the end of the project
    - so we have nice UI and user-centered design before we start messing around
- ok to have limited # of features but good implementations of each feature
- professor is leaving it open. he wants to see creativity.
  - we covered what he wants 
  - he wants us to come up with our own ideas
  - Dev said he thinks we understood the idea well
  - Dev said we can start coding
- Dev's suggestions on data saving
  - mongodb
  - SQL lite - use SQL database
  - vSQL lite
  - wants us to review the complexity
