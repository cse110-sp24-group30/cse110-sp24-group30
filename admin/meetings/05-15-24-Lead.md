# 05-15-24 Lead Meeting with Dev

## Notes
- Already using github issues good start --> use more issues as we progress
- We can then see who is working on different features and keep our project organized
- we should assign more different people to do code reviews
- Workflow looks good
  - Linting
  - Unit Testing
  - Static Analysis (run on the code before merging --> helps to see induvidual vulneraabilities that we might not be aware of)
    - Easy to integrate one line of code
  - JSDocs
  - Add Depender Bot 
    - Using for import/export upto-date libraries
  - Slack Notifications 
- Make sure we are not having a bus factor
  - Keep assigning tasks out and having clear, open communication
  - Keep monitoring progress of different people
