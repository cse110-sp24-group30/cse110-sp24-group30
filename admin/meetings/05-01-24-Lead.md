# 05-01-24 Lead Meeting with Dev

## Notes
- Dev said a few of the buttons did not respond
  - the HP bar did not update
  - said we won't get docked points but it's something to keep in mind
- Dev asked if we had a chance to brainstorm
  - we responded that we will do a when2meet
- Dev highly recommends we continue to do SWE practice (trello, issue, etc)
- Dev asked how our experience was
  - we responded it was very positive. team was responsive
  - we had to rush ending of functionality towards the end
  - assured dev that we will do more testing in the future
- Dev highly recommends that we test ASAP
  - as soon as it's merged in the main branch
  - if something doesn't work, we need to identify it ASAP bc it might affect other features in the future
- Dev wants us to have demos throughout the weeks so he can give active feedback

## Questions from us to Dev
- when should we do demo? during lead meetings or schedule another day?
  - Dev is okay with doing custom checkpoints. set up short call where Dev can drop in, give us review, then drop out
- do you have any general advice?
  - focus on user experience and how everything works
  - look at every button on the app
  - make sure everything works as expected and feel free to add fancy things after
  - doesn't necessarily need fancy (sentiment widget for example)
    - just needs to have good experience
