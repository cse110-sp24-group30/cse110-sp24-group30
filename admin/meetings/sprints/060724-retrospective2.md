## Retrospective Focus: Start, Stop, Continue
- **Objective:** Reflect on the past sprint to identify what practices and behaviors to start, stop, and continue to improve our team performance as we near the end stage of the project. This approach aims to optimize our workflow, recognize productive habits, and help us make final touches to our project before we submit it. 

### Start (New actions or behaviors to implement)
1. **UI Polish and Consistency**
   - **Description:** Focus on refining the user interface across all 3 different modules and prioritize user interface to make it seamless and all connected with each other. 
   - **Action Plan:** Offer our friends/classmates in other classes other than CSE 110 to try our developers journal and have them critique our project, in terms of ease of use, functionalities, and user centered design

2. **Module Integration Testing**
   - **Description:** Implement thorough testing to ensure that the calendar, todo list, and journal modules are seamlessly integrated. For example, when adding a task to the to-do, it should be reflected onto the calendar widget as well, and vice-versa 
   - **Action Plan:** Develop and execute comprehensive test cases that cover interactions between the modules

### Stop (Current practices or behaviors to discontinue)
1. **Ad-Hoc Changes**
   - **Description:** Avoid making ad-hoc changes that disrupt the project flow and introduce potential bugs especially since we are at the end of the project
   - **Action Plan:** Implement a change freeze for new features and focus solely on polishing and integrating existing functionality

2. **Ignoring UI Consistency**
   - **Description:** Stop neglecting the importance of UI consistency across different modules
   - **Action Plan:** Prioritize a unified design language and ensure all elements adhere to this standard

3. **Rushed Code Merges**
   - **Description:** Avoid rushing code merges without thorough reviews which can introduce bugs
   - **Action Plan:** Ensure all merges are peer-reviewed and pass all automated tests before integration

### Continue (Effective practices or behaviors to maintain)
1. **Continue making PRs and logging it into Github Projects**
   - **Description:** Continue making PRs from the 6 main branches that we have, but rather than focusing on developing new functionalities, focus on enuring existing functionalities work successfully
   - **Feedback:** Start clearing out all the Github Issues on our project tracker and prioritize issues 

2. **Learning Sessions**
   - **Description:** Organize zoom/in person session where team members can share their codebase and what they are working on
   - **Feedback:** Schedule at least one last meeting with the team before we submit the project

By reflecting on our recent sprint using the Start, Stop, Continue method, we aim to enhance our workflow and project outcomes. Implementing these action items will help us build on our strengths, address our weaknesses, and ensure a successful project submission.
