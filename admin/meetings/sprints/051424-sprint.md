## Notes
- no good idea on what journal functions we should have
- jounral features
  - journal entries
  - functionality to add title
  - documentation text box
  - reflection text box
- question: how to go about journal itself?
  - **idea 1**
  - widget for journal?
  - direct to new page on click
  - **idea 2**
  - pop up on same page
  - **idea 3**
  - kind of like vs code
  - journals on the side
  - can click into it
  - add nav bar 
  - keep adding to it

## Tentative plan - journal dashboard
- visit journal page
  - view: a bunch of journals available
  - option to add journal top left corner
- double click existing journal -> lead to new page for that journal
  - easy way first (same page)
  - extra time -> try hard (switch pages)
- just delete button on journal
  - pop up that says are u sure
- on click create new journal -> pop up widget for title and description etc...
  - lead to new page created for that journal
- if have time -> ali's idea of a list of recent journals available on the side

## Tentative plan - journal entry page 
- simplistic view for now
- have save button on top
