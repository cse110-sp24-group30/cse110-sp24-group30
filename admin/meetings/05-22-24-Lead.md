# 05-22-24 Lead Meeting with Dev

## Notes
- do you think prof is expecting localstorage or data storage
  - don't expect database. but up to us
  - don't want us to add complexity unless it's necessary
- if we want to scale up to SQLite, go ahead
  - aren't grading us on what we use
- can optimize local storage for simplicity
  - might make entire project a lot easier
- dev wants us to make a video for EC
